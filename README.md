# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

This week's homework involves working with databases and tables with mySQL. Overall, the project is a simple program that involves prompts from the command line, however having to display, create and edit data with SQL is new and confusing to me. Overall, the project was enjoyable, but there were quite a few difficulties along the way.

## User Story
```
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
